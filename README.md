my little bundle of telemetry

if something feels off these are the things i look at first.\
sooo i bundled up a cosy little bash script to help me diagnose.

for the temperatures and fan speeds needs the -> lm-sensors <- package!\
and for your use case you may need to tweak the -> sensors | grep <- line!

tested on ubuntu 22.04.4
